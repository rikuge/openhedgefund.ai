Installation
---------------------

1.1: Install Poetry
---------------------
https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation

1.2: Install TA-Lib:
---------------------
https://github.com/mrjbq7/ta-lib

*Important: I've included a WHL with binaries and installed the package through Poetry.
If you are Linux/Ubuntu/OSX or another Windows/Python version you'll need to 
install through another means.
